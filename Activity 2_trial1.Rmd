# The adherent group's average daily CPAP usage was considerably higher 
# (approximately 6.4 hours per night) than that of the non-adherent group 
# (approximately 1.6 hours per night, p < 0.001).

# In plain English, adherent participants utilized their CPAP machines for 
# significantly extended periods of time each night.  This affirms that the 
# adherence status is indicative of the actual treatment behavior and emphasizes
# that device utilization is the primary determining factor between the 2 groups.
 
## 1C.Choose a single characteristic with a non-significant p-value when 
## comparing between adherence and non-adherent groups, and describe in 2-3 
## sentences what this means in plain English.
 
# There was no significant difference in age between adherent and non-adherent 
# participants (p ≈ 0.90).

# This implies that the adherence to CPAP was not influenced by the age of the 
# participants; younger and older individuals were equally likely to be adherent
# or non-adherent.  In layman's terms, the frequency with which an individual 
# employs their CPAP device does not seem to be influenced by their age.

##3. Hypothesis Test: Probability of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness at Baseline vs. 6 Months
# The objective is to ascertain if the likelihood of excessive daytime drowsiness, as determined by a cutoff score of 6 or above on the ODSI (Observation and Interview Based Diurnal drowsiness Inventory), is consistent from baseline to 6 months.

 # State the Hypotheses Null Hypothesis (H₀): The likelihood of excessive daytime drowsiness remains constant from baseline to the 6-month mark.

## Pick the Right TesTest: 
# This is a comparison of the probabilities (proportions) of two groups: 
# baseline and 6 months.  Because we are working with categorical data 
# (whether or not someone is excessively sleepy), a McNemar's test or a 
# Chi-squared test would work. However, we will utilize the McNemar's test 
# for paired categorical data (baseline vs. 6 months for the same people).

## Get the Data Ready: 
# We need to make a variable that shows if someone has excessive daytime 
# sleepiness (ODSI > 6) at the start and again at 6 months.

## Make a variable with two values:
# 1 for too much sleepiness during the day (ODSI ≥ 6)
# 0 for not being too sleepy during the day (ODSI < 6)

# Create a binary variable for ODSI ≥ 6 at baseline and 6 months
Data$baseline_sleepy <- ifelse(Data$ODSI_baseline >= 6, 1, 0)
Data$month6_sleepy <- ifelse(Data$ODSI_6m >= 6, 1, 0)

## Create a contingency table for McNemar's test
table_sleepiness <- table(Data$baseline_sleepy, Data$month6_sleepy)

## Perform McNemar's test
mcnemar_test <- mcnemar.test(table_sleepiness)
mcnemar_test

## Conclusion 
# Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value (0.0001357) is less than 0.05.

# There is a statistically significant difference in the likelihood of excessive 
# daytime sleepiness (ODSI > 6) between the baseline and 6 months.

# To put it another way, the chances of experiencing too much daytime sleepiness 
# at the start are not the same as the chances at 6 months. This indicates that 
# the variation in tiredness across time is substantial in the sample.

# p-value: The p-value of 1 means that it is very unlikely that the sample mean 
# MMSE is less than 23.  The p-value being more than 0.05 means that there isn't
# enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  To put it another way: 
# This indicates that there is no substantial difference between the sample mean 
# and the threshold value of 23, hence supporting the null hypothesis.

# Conclusion for non-statistical people: We do not reject the null hypothesis 
# because the p-value is quite high (1).  This indicates that the study 
# participants possess a mean MMSE score exceeding 23, with no substantial 
# evidence of cognitive impairment among the sample.

# Understanding the t-statistic: The t-statistic of 34.08 is exceptionally high,
# which means that the sample mean MMSE is far higher than the criterion for 
# cognitive impairment, which is 23.  This shows that the sample mean and the 
# hypothesized population mean are very different from each other.

# Understanding the p-value: The p-value of 1 is exceptionally high.  
# This means that the sample mean MMSE is very unlikely to be less than 23.
# This means that there is no proof to reject the null hypothesis.

# We can't reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is higher than 0.05.

# Conclusion for an Audience Without Statistics background: The p-value is 1, 
# which suggests that the participants' average MMSE score is much higher than 
# 23. This means that there is no proof that the individuals are cognitively 
# impaired based on the MMSE score. In other words, we can't say for sure that 
# the people in this study have cognitive problems solely on the MMSE results.

## Interpretation: 
# The average daily CPAP use in this sample is approximately 5.15 hours per

# Report the proportion
proportion_less_than_3

# Interpretation: About 20.7% of the participants in the study use their CPAP 
# machine for less than 3 hours per night. This suggests that a significant 
# portion of the participants may not be adhering to the recommended CPAP usage,
# which could potentially affect the effectiveness of the therapy.

# To put it simply, about 20.7% of the people in this study use their CPAP 
# machine for less than three hours a night.  This shows that a lot of people 
# aren't using the CPAP machine for the right period of time, which could make

## Interpretation: 
# The individuals in this study have an average BMI of 42.18, which is far 
# higher than the acceptable range of 18.5 to 24.9.

# The standard deviation of 7.21 indicates significant variability in BMI 
# among participants.

# The study found that about 96% of the people who took part had a BMI of 30 
# or more, which means they were obese.  This means that most of the people 
# in this study are overweight or obese, which is something to keep in mind

#INTERPRETATION: 
# The histogram of 1,000 sample averages for the non-adherent group creates 
# a smooth, bell-shaped curve that is centered around 35.6. The red normal curve
# overlay fits it rather well, which shows that the sample means are roughly 
# normal. The spread is small (approximately 2 AHI points), which means that 
# the averages from groups of 100 non-adherent participants don't change much 
# between samples.

# A comparison with Part (D)
# This empirical sampling distribution, derived from numerous simulations, 
# roughly aligns with the theoretical distribution shown in part (D).
# Both have means that are very close to each other (≈ 35.6) and standard errors 
# that are very close to each other (≈ 2, which shows that theory and simulation concur.
# In plain terms, whether you use math to figure it out or resample it, the results reveal that the average AHI for users who don't follow the rules is stable, predictable, and normally distributed when the sample sizes are big.

#INTERPRETATION: 
# The average AHI levels for both groups are almost the same (34–36), 
# but the ranges are different.The sampling distribution for the non-adherent 
# group is tighter and more consistent since it is based on a higher sample 
# size (100), which cuts down on random fluctuation.
 
# At the same time, the adherent group's distribution is wider since smaller 
# samples (n = 30) naturally cause their averages to change more.
# In simple terms, the average severity of apnea is about the same for both 
# groups. However, the estimates for non-adherent users are more steady and 
# predictable than those for adherent users.
